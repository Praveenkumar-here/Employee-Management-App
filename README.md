# Employee Management App

This is my first Angular project—a simple and functional Employee Management application demonstrating core Angular essentials and integration with a Swagger-powered backend API.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.0.


## Features

- Responsive UI built with Bootstrap for clean and modern styling
- Implements essential Angular concepts:
  - Property Binding
  - Event Binding
  - Routing with multiple views/pages
  - HttpClient for API communication
- Connects to a Swagger API backend for employee data management
- Full CRUD operations:
  - Create new employees
  - Read/display existing employee details and designations
  - Update employee information
  - Delete employees
- Clear data flow between frontend and backend using REST API calls

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Angular CLI installed globally (optional but recommended)

### Installation and Running

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Praveenkumar-here/Employee-Management-App.git
cd Employee-Management-App


2. Install dependencies
    npm install


3. Run the development server
    ng serve


4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

Make sure your backend Swagger API is running and accessible by the Angular app for full functionality.

## Project Structure

- `src/app` — Angular components, services, and routing modules
- `src/assets` — Static files such as styles, images
- `package.json` — Project dependencies and scripts

## What I Learned

- Angular fundamentals and best practices
- Bootstrap integration with Angular components
- Consuming RESTful API endpoints using HttpClient
- Managing state and data interaction between frontend and backend
- Handling user input and form validation

## Future Improvements

- Add pagination and search for employee list
- Implement user authentication and role-based access
- Enhance UI/UX with Angular Material or other design libraries

## Feedback and Contributions

This is a learning project created to solidify my Angular skills. Feel free to comment, suggest improvements, or contribute!

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
